# Grocery-Store-Billing-System
The Grocery Store Billing System is a console-based tool for efficient billing. It allows users to add items, apply a 10% discount with a promo code, and choose payment methods (Cash, Card, or UPI). It generates an itemized bill with totals and saves it as a CSV file for record-keeping.
